      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Since the age of 11, I have been passionate about software development and have been actively learning and growing my skills in this field. After completing my Bachelor of Science in Business Information Systems, I gained valuable experience working with SAP/ABAP in the public sector for four years. I then made the decision to become a freelance developer, specializing in web development with a focus on React and other popular frameworks. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in order to provide high-quality solutions for my clients.</p>
      <p>I am also a professional paragliding pilot.</p>
